# SumoBot
A robot designed with the intentions of pushing opposing robots out of a ring. Built from scratch (chassis, PCB, hardware, programming, etc.) with an Arduino. In this project, I applied my knowledge of the Arduino programming language (which is essentially C++) and the basics of handling hardware.
